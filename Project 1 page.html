    <br><br><h3>Introduction of the Project</h3><hr>
    <p>Nowadays, non-renewable energy causes damage and pollution to the environment caused by burning fossil fuels and the increasing demand for oils has been a concern. Therefore, renewable energy such as solar energy is expanding due to the introduction of the RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standard). However, research found that there is a lack of land space for installing overland photovoltaic systems, thus innovating the floating photovoltaic (FPV) system.
    <br><br>Floating Solar, also called floating photovoltaics (FPV), are solar panels mounted on a structure that floats on a body of water. Unlike traditional solar installations on land and rooftops, the FPV system offers a range of unique advantages in terms of energy generation and environmental impact. Therefore, in this project, a Floating Solar Panel Monitoring System is constructed to improve the efficiency of the solar panel for greater power generation.</p>

    <br><h3>Advantages of Floating Solar Panel</h3><hr>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Promote land-use efficiency.</b> While the floating PV energy systems are installed on the water, alternative uses for the land are possible. There is no need to build new infrastructure or convert farms and forests to make way for solar power plants.</li><br>
        <li><b>Generate more electricity.</b> Through the cooling effects of water, floating solar panels are able to produce more power than those located on land. The solar panels may retain their coolness and absorb more solar energy when they are near water. Thus, reducing the temperature of the solar module and increasing the energy generation of the solar panel.</li><br>
        <li><b>Reduce evaporation.</b> Solar panels that are mounted on top of the water bodies are able to reduce the evaporation of water from ponds and reservoir as it blocks the sunlight. Increased water availability for communities is a great result of floatovoltaics on drinking water reservoirs. Especially for places that are experiencing a drought, it is an excellent choice.</li>
